# SaraDog-PetShop
## :point_right: Project Introduction :point_left:
**SaraDog PetShop** is my defense web application project for **ASP.NET Core** course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg) (May-August 2023).

At SaraDog PetShop, the delightful Chihuahua, Sara, takes center stage as our beloved mascot. She proudly models the products we offer, reflecting the love and care we have for all pets. With a user-friendly interface, the website allows you to **sort products by Name, Price, or Date Added**. You can also conveniently **search for specific items by category or keywords**. Explore various sections tailored to cater to each **category's** unique offerings.

For your shopping convenience, have a special **"Favorites"** section where you can keep track of products you wish to follow for potential discounts or order at a later time. Additionally, the **"Order History"** feature allows you to easily monitor your past purchases.

In the **"Profile Settings"**, you have the freedom to personalize your experience. Choose an **avatar** that resonates with you and **add important details** such as your Address, First Name, Last Name, and more.

## :construction_worker: Admin Panel

Saradog PetShop boasts a robust Admin Panel, granting on administrators and moderators extensive control. Through this panel, authorized personnel can effortlessly manage products and categories. Administrator possess special privileges, allowing them to elevate users to moderators or revoke such permissions as needed.

The Admin Panel also offers the convenience of an "Enable/Disable" button for products. In the event of a product being out of stock, moderators can simply click this button to make it temporarily unavailable for users.
